  abstract = {Van der Pol's equation for a relaxation oscillator is generalized
	by the addition of terms to produce a pair of non-linear differential
	equations with either a stable singular point or a limit cycle. The
	resulting “BVP model” has two variables of state, representing excitability
	and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical
	model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as
	a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems
	including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon.
	The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to
	the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory,
	enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a “physiological state diagram,”
	with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized.
	A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space
	onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying
	relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the
	BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which
	make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

  journal = {New Journal of Physics},

  volume = {17},
  pages = {045029},

  abstract = {We consider a simple Markovian class of the stochastic Wilson–Cowan
	type models of neuronal network dynamics, which incorporates stochastic
	delay caused by the existence of a refractory period of neurons.
	From the point of view of the dynamics of the individual elements,
	we are dealing with a network of non-Markovian stochastic two-state
	oscillators with memory, which are coupled globally in a mean-field
	fashion. This interrelation of a higher-dimensional Markovian and
	lower-dimensional non-Markovian dynamics is discussed in its relevance
	to the general problem of the network dynamics of complex elements
	possessing memory. The simplest model of this class is provided by
	a three-state Markovian neuron with one refractory state, which causes
	firing delay with an exponentially decaying memory within the two-state
	reduced model. This basic model is used to study critical avalanche
	dynamics (the noise sustained criticality) in a balanced feedforward
	network consisting of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Such
	avalanches emerge due to the network size dependent noise (mesoscopic
	noise). Numerical simulations reveal an intermediate power law in
	the distribution of avalanche sizes with the critical exponent around
	−1.16. We show that this power law is robust upon a variation of
	the refractory time over several orders of magnitude. However, the
	avalanche time distribution is biexponential. It does not reflect
	any genuine power law dependence.},
